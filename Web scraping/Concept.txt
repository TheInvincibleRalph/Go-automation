Web scraping is the process of programmatically extracting data from websites. In Go, web scraping can be done using packages like net/http for making HTTP requests and golang.org/x/net/html or third-party libraries like goquery for parsing HTML.


To parse and query HTML documents means to programmatically analyze and extract information from the HTML structure of web pages. Here's a more detailed explanation of each term:

Parsing HTML
Parsing HTML refers to the process of analyzing the HTML markup of a webpage to build a structured representation of the content, often in the form of a Document Object Model (DOM) tree. This allows a program to understand the structure and elements of the HTML document.

HTML Structure: HTML documents are structured hierarchically with nested tags (elements). Each tag can contain attributes and content.
DOM Tree: When an HTML document is parsed, it's transformed into a tree-like structure called the DOM, where each node represents an HTML element.
For example, consider the following HTML snippet:

html
Copy code
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Example</h1>
    <p>This is an example paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
Parsing this HTML would create a DOM tree with html as the root node, containing head and body as child nodes, and so on.

Querying HTML
Querying HTML refers to the process of searching and selecting specific elements within the parsed HTML document (DOM). This is similar to using SQL to query a database. Querying allows you to locate and extract the specific data you are interested in.

Selectors: Querying is typically done using selectors, which can be tag names, class names, IDs, or other attributes.
Manipulation: Once elements are selected, you can read their content, attributes, or manipulate them as needed.
For instance, using a tool like goquery in Go, you can query elements with jQuery-like syntax.
